        <p class="yapContent">I am Raghav Bahukhandi, currently a second year student pursuing BTech in CSE. I am a fullstack developer with experience in developing webapps with flask, Next.js and ruby on rails. I have been developing since 11th grade and have familiarized myself in a bunch of languages such as Python, Ruby, C/C++ and Javascript. I am also familiar with platforms such as GCP, Cloudinary , Resend, Razorpay etc. Last summer I interned at a startup called Auto Verdure where I learnt a lot of technologies mentioned before.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="yapContent">I enjoy building stuff and spend a lot of time working on hobby projects, a lot of which are made over a weekend or two when I am free from college. My interests mainly include backend development and lower level development. Recently I have been trying to recreate tools used by developers, such as git, mimicking which I created beanVC, a small scale version control management system, this was my minor project for last semester. This semester I am working on bento, a lightweight command line text editor similar to vim. I recently also built muCLI which was a command line music player.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="yapContent">Currently, I am interested in taking up on opportunities that will help grow and in meeting people who will help me learn. I am seeking start ups that may find my skillset useful at their company and would love to work with them during summer of 2025. </p>
