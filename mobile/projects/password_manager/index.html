        <p class="yapContent">This app was a password manager that I built as I had a need to store my passwords. It allowed users to store their passwords for multiple apps, but also create random passwords of varying lengths and options such as include numbers and include special characters. The app used a main password that was used to access the application, this password was hashed and stored, and the hash was compared at each log in. Furthermore, the rest of the passwords were stored after being encrypted. The application also had a searching feature. This is one of the few projects that I have built that I used regularly for a long time.</p>
